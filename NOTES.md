JSX styles: No Effect for Nested Component

This feature of styled-jsx helps you to manage styles for bigger apps.

Also: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. They must contained within the HTML element itself!

Also, use :global to generate an unprefixed class that you can pass to 3rd-party components (like using *):  https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx#global-selectors
